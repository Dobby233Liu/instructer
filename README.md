# instructer

Attmept to recreate a Ren'Py project from built files.

The name is also a attmepted merge of "inflict" and "restructure", "-er"'d because this tool is doing that.

# Dependencies

This tool requires Python 2.7 and Python 3.x installed together (what the fuck). The `main` module, which excepts a interactive terminal, itself requires only Python 3. 

Used libraries: unrpa and unrpyc, included through submodules (sync before use!)
